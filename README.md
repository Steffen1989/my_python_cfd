# my_python_cfd
This is supposed to be a collection of several python scripts mostly taken from the wonderful tutorial "12 steps to Navier-Stokes" from Prof. Lorena Barba (https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython)

The idea is to finish this tutorial by coding a simple CFD solver in order to improve the basic understanding of the underlying numerics.
