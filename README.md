# my_python_cfd
This is supposed to be a collection of several python scripts mostly taken from the wonderful tutorial "12 steps to Navier-Stokes" from Prof. Lorena Barba, Copyright (c) Barba group: https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython 
As stated in their License, I just included their LICENSE again into this repository.

The idea is to finish this tutorial by coding a simple CFD solver in order to improve the basic understanding of the underlying numerics.
